Hi, here you have to upload the dataset also can choose from the sample dataset, and then you can build an ml model by just clicking without writing a single line of code. You will be able to tune the hyperparameter for the algorithms, there are 4 algorithms for both Regression and Classification.
🛠 Experiment through algorithms that gives you a better result.

For the complete and full reading go to the About & Detailed Project Report where I briefly describe the project and how to use it. also, you can find Video Explanation of the project there.

📊 Data Profiling
Here you can perform certain things like exploring the dataset, and get a complete understanding of your data through visualizing the dataset in every aspect got to the Data Profiling page for more.

🏂 Regression
After becoming with your data you can now build a machine learning model. also you can perform the data preprocessing steps here. like categorical label encoding and scaling the numerical values. got to the Regression page if you want to create a regression model.

⛹️‍♂️ Classification
Now if you are up to the classification problem today go to Classificatin where you can build a classification model.
