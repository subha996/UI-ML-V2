    Here You can upload a dataset(also can choose from sample datasets that are given) and can create a basic machine learning model for both `Regression` and `Classification`. and can check the performance of the model,
     if you are not satisfied with the result, then you can tune the `hyperparameters` of the model and again run the model on the chosen hyperparameter. This is `not` an `AutoML` you may need some prior 
     knowledge about the algorithms and the impact of that hyperparameter on the model.  
     After creating the model you can download the trained model and can use it other times. 
     You Don't have to write a single line of code, the full process is `UI-Based`, all you have to just `Choose and Click.` 
     There is another section called `Data Profiling` where you have to just upload your dataset and complete the EDA report
      will create there for you. There you can explore and become one with your data.
        Remember every tab is here `volatile`, which means if you leave one page in the middle of your work, your progress will lost."""

    Also if you do not have any data in your hand you can choose sample data, that option you can find from `sidebar` after that you have to select
    the `target` column of your data, after that you have to choose which algorithm you will use, after choosing the algorithm
    you will be given some basic hyperparameter to tune them on the right side of the page. after selecting parameter you need to click
    the `Train and Give Socre` button, then after few secceon latter you can see the performance of the model. And if you are not satisfied

    You can also see the `covariance` matrix of the data, which will tell you the relation between the features.
    You can also see the `scatterplot` of the data, which will tell you the relation between the features.

    # writing about how things done
    about_how_things_done = """
    Now I will describe how all things are going. If you are not interested in reading this, you can watch the video explanation that i also created where I show the full demonstration and code walkthrough.
    
    1. Now let me tell you how the thing is going. First, you are uploading data(or choosing from samples) you will show the dataset is load on the web page. 
    
    2. After that, you have to select your `target` column on the data. otherwise, the process will through error message to tell you to select the target column, you will be provided a list of all the columns present on the uploaded data and you have to select the target column for your problem. Internally the data will be divided into taring data and testing data, so i can give you some performance measures about the model on unseen data also.

    3. After selecting the target column you have to choose the `Algorithm` you want to use, there I provided the 4 most used and common algorithms for `Regression` and `Classification` problems. after selecting the algorithm you will given hyperparameter for tuning them, the default parameters are set by default, if you want to run the algorithm by default parameter, then leave those control as it is.

    4. Then click the `Train and Give Score` button to train the model and after training the model it will show you the general performance measure that you usually do after creating a model. 
    In the case of the `Regression Problem`, you will be provided `r2_score` the common measurement for the regression problems. the value lies between `0 to 1` and the more closer the value is to `1` the good model it is. 

    5. Also there will be `training` and `testing` plots where you get the idea about how the model is predicting values on training data as well as testing data. and `Residual` plot also be there to check the residual of prediction, the residual is the difference between target values to the predicted value, if the mean of your residual distribution is close to zero, it can be a good sign, if the distribution is spread far from mean that can sign of bad model.

    6. Now when you create your first model, and of course you will not be satisfied with the result(if yes then you are very lucky). then tune the `hyperparameters` from the widget I provided. 
    `Note` here, in the time of tuning hyperparameter wait at least for `2 seconds` and then change the other hyperparameter, because when changing some hyperparameter the model will run by that new hyperparameter, so it is recommended wait at least few sec before tune others hyperparameters, also you can get the notification from the `top right side` where a `RUNNING` sign will pop-up which tells you the code is running inside. Then run experiments as long as you want, you might change the `algorithm` from the sidebar menu if a particular algorithm is not working well with your data. you have 4 different algorithm there for both problem types.

    7. There is one checkbox `Apply Preprocessing`, you will find it when you will build the model not before that. If your data is come with some column with categorical value and not completely ready for feeding to the ml algorithms, then you can check that button, unless if you have preprocessed data, means you have taken care all categorical encoding and scaling the data if needed, then leave `uncheck` that box. if not then that function will do some preprocessing for your data before feeding it to the model. Only `OneHotEncoding` and `StandardScaling` will apply,  and also you will download the full pipeline. so it is recommended to use preprocess data.
    
    7. Now when you finish the model-building part, now you can download the trained model you will be given at the bottom of the page. Click on that link to download the model as `pickle` file.
